Creative Writing Challenge #89

The Rig advanced slowly through the snowy terrain, its hydraulics getting increasingly covered in snow as the storm progressed. Much of it would be shaken by the movement and friction of its shiny white bioplastic-coated panels as its digitigrade legs flexed and its weighted shoulders rebalanced its body, but Tibia would still have to take control of the machine from time to time, placing the mug of hot cocoa she'd been cupping in her hands as well as the blanket she'd covered herself with to the side, shifting into driver position inside the cockpit, and disabling its autonomous mode as she felt its rhythm slow down, the Rig unable to shake off the snow for much longer.

She was getting nervous. Even as her hands slid to the slick ergonomic controls of the Rig, as she felt herself embody the machine's limbs, as she eyed the dashboard indicators glowing green and within expected parameters, and as the smell of hot cocoa permeated the cockpit, the storm had gotten to her. As the rate at which this small ritual needed to be performed increased, it had turned from an excuse to take manual control of the Rig and have it do a little dance she could laugh at herself with, to a hole in her stomach. How many times had she had to do it now? Three? Five? Tibia was mad at herself for the stray thought. Rigs were built to last, malfunctions were extremely uncommon as production of high-tech machinery was highly regulated and only repurposed and prepared on-demand; this time of the year was the only time many people would come into contact with a Rig, or any kind of complex machine, in their lives.

Maybe the memories of her own encounter with a machine such as this one had been the reason she'd been so eager to sign up to the PhysDelivery corps once the opportunity had presented itself. Her previous -and first- labor assignment as a horticultural technician had seemed a good, safe choice: she wouldn't have to move away from her family and acquaintances (though many were departing to assignments of their own), she'd meet plenty of new people and she really truly loved plants. It was one of the most respected labor posts in Syzygy and first timer labor applicants would often find it as one of their options once they were done with their education cycle. She'd loved it at first, but it had gotten complicated: she'd found out interacting with people could be exhausting; customers but specially her coworkers, who hadn't taken well to her (specially Ember, who - she didn't want to think about them), and she rarely had time to herself. So when her first cycle at the post had finished, Tibia decided to try something new. She impulsively left her labor preferences form empty, hoping for fate (or chance) to show her a way out of this newfound rut, and once she was presented with an open position as a Physical Delivery Conductor among her options, she took it as a sign and chose it despite her family's protests.

It'd been 6 months since then and Tibia had learned plenty. She'd memorized technical manuals, gone through Rig training (which she was proud to had passed with flying colors), and learnt that Physical Deliveries weren't only about carrying letters and gifts to friends and family from their loved ones who couldn't make the trip through Syzygy themselves, but also about preserving important cultural and religious practices that required the passing of physical objects, from sacred relics to handmade charms, which just couldn't be replaced through digital means. Some of Tibia's happiest memories were of receiving toys and letters from friends and relatives from the hands of a Rig Conductor at year's end, easily their busiest season, their white shiny Rig standing tall unlike anything she'd ever seen, and although she'd felt guilty of said memories as she heard and read people's criticisms of the service as a waste of resources, now she knew those views often came from those unaware of how precious and important its cargo could be to the right person or communities.

She'd completed the same route she was on now three months prior, as part of her training. Her destination, Whitevale, was a small settlement that didn't require multiple Rigs for each delivery, but she'd come along with an experienced conductor and two other apprentices to accumulate experience. It'd been easy, even fun; they'd spent the three day journey joking around and singing karaoke through their intercoms, catching up on audioserials they'd prepared for the journey, and getting acquainted with their Rigs' rhythms as they made their way through the then-significantly greener terrain. Outside communication was always an option; the wireless commu-net blanketed the small planet with ease, but most of the route included protected areas with communication limitations in place, as it could disrupt certain fauna and flora behaviors, and any transmissions within it were strictly meant only for emergencies, involving paperwork and extra work for someone back at HQ. She'd considered it a blessing in disguise, another sign she was exactly where she wanted to be.

Tibia had woken up early last week to sign up for the year end delivery shift to Whitevale; she'd been looking forward to taking the place of the conductor in her memory, handing toys to gleeful children at the village, sent from friends and family they only saw on their commu-net pads. Now a full-fledged Rig conductor, she'd have to make the trip alone, but that hadn't given her much pause as she'd barely had to take the controls on her last journey anyway, save for when their instructor took some time to explain some quirk or another about the machine's workings. She'd put her knowledge to use, become a local celebrity among kids for a day, and prove to herself those days feeling stuck and rejected were behind her.

Now, however, with the hole in her stomach growing larger by the minute as the Rig's operation became a constant concern, a bug of regret had began to worm itself within her, and it kept asking what she was doing in a repurposed machine from the old world in the middle of nowhere, playing a hero from her memories. She kept playing back the decisions that had led her to this moment, searching for when she'd made the wrong move. The weather report hadn't predicted any adverse conditions this week, though the region was known for its sudden snowfalls. Would her superiors have let her come had they known of the incoming storm? They didn't raise any objections when she signed up for the job, but had they made a mistake? Were they overconfident? Or did they sneer behind her back at a new conductor too full of herself, thinking of this as some rite of passage? Where her coworkers laughing now, expecting her to break the communication restrictions at any moment? She tried to brush the thoughts aside, she knew her mind was conflating her experience at the farm with the present; everyone she'd met so far seemed well intentioned. She reminded herself to breath; surely she'd look back on this experience and laugh (she could feel the legs's rhythm wane again), just another Rig trip of many she'd go on to complete this cycle (hadn't she *just* shaken the snow off? She hadn't even taken the mug back into her hands), she imagined herself again first handing the toys to children, and then being praised by the other conductors back at HQ (the storm was so bad now she could barely see ahead, a blur of white manifesting in the Rig's screen), but the visions became harder to hold onto, like trying to track dandelion seeds scattered to the wind.

Tibia's head began to feel light, and her vision began to blur as if the storm on her screen was leaking into the Rig. The smell of cocoa suddenly felt nauseating, her breaths getting increasingly uneven and hollow. She scrambled to steady herself inside the cockpit, hitting her shoulder in the process. This felt like a betrayal, the machine she'd come to trust as an extension of herself now felt constrictive and rejecting, as if in revolt.

She gripped the controls with as much strength as she could muster, her legs tense as if her seat could fall from under her at any moment, and began the override sequence again, desperate to wrestle control of the Rig's movement from itself and the weather. She knew she was spiraling, but thought the feeling of embodying the huge machine again would bring her reassurance. As soon as her arms were fitted to the commands and control released to her though, she knew something was wrong; the nimbleness with which she'd been able to maneuver it earlier today wasn't there, and she wasn't sure how much of this sluggishness came from her or the Rig finally buckling under the snow. She tried again, directing the Rig's legs in a practiced manner, expecting the machine to match her movements and convince her that what she was feeling was her nerves after all, but this time it clearly wasn't able to pick up the pace. With a mix of leftover panic and frustration, she yanked the machine forward, as if pulling on an invisible leash from ahead, willing it into submission with force. The Rig's left leg gave out, sinking into the snow and turning the cockpit red from the indicator alarm signaling a mechanical fault.
