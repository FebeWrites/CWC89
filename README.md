Creative Writing Challenge #89

The Rig advanced slowly through the snowy terrain, its hydraulics getting increasingly covered in snow as the storm progressed. Much of it would be shaken by the movement and friction of its white, shiny bioplastic-coated panels as its digitigrade legs flexed and its weighted shoulders rebalanced its body, but Tibia would still have to take control of the machine from time to time, placing the mug of hot cocoa she'd been cupping in her hands as well as the blanket she'd covered herself with to the side, shifting into driver position inside the cockpit, and disabling its autonomous mode as she felt its rhythm slow down, the Rig unable to shake off the snow for much longer.

She had to admit to herself she was nervous. Even as her hands slid to the slick, ergonomic controls of the Rig, as she felt herself embody the machine's limbs, as all indicators glowed green and within expected parameters and as the smell of hot cocoa permeated the cockpit, the storm had gotten to her. As this small ritual needed to be performed increasingly often, it had turned from an excuse to take manual control and make the Rig do a little dance she could laugh at herself with, to a hole in her stomach. How many times had she had to do it now? Three? Five? Tibia was mad at herself for the stray thought. Rigs were built to last, malfunctions were extremely uncommon as production of high-tech machinery was highly regulated and only done on-demand; this time of the year was the only time many people would come into contact with a Rig, or any kind of complex machine, in their lives.

Maybe that had been the reason she'd been so eager to sign up to the PhysDelivery corps once the opportunity had presented itself. Her previous -and first- labor assignment as a horticultural technician had seemed a good, safe choice; she wouldn't have to move away from her family and acquaintances (though many were departing to assignments of their own), she'd meet plenty of new people and she really truly loved plants. It was one of the most respected labor posts in Syzygy and first timer labor applicants would often find it as one of their options once they were done with their education cycle. She'd loved it at first, but it had gotten complicated: she'd found out interacting with customers could be exhausting, specially her coworkers, who hadn't taken well to her personality (specially Ember, who - she didn't want to think about it) and rarely had time. So when her first cycle at the post had finished, Tibia decided to try something new. She impulsively left her preferences form empty, hoping for fate (or randomness) to show her a new way, and once she was presented with an open position as a Physical Delivery Conductor among her options, she knew it'd be the perfect way to start anew.

Since then Tibia had learned plenty. She'd memorized technical manuals, gone through Rig training (which she was proud to had passed with flying colors), and learnt that Physical Deliveries weren't only about carrying letters and gifts to friends and family from their loved ones who couldn't make the trip through Syzygy themselves at year's end, but also about preserving important cultural and religious practices that required the passing of physical objects, from sacred relics to handmade charms, that just couldn't be replaced through digital means. Some of Tibia's happiest memories were of receiving toys and letters from friends and relatives from the hands of a Rig Conductor at years end, their white shiny Rig standing tall unlike anything she'd ever seen, and had even felt guilty as she heard and read people's criticisms of the service as a waste of resources, but now she knew those views often came from those unaware of how precious and important its cargo could be to the right person.

She'd completed this route three months prior as part of her training; her destination, Whitevale, was a small settlement that didn't require multiple Rigs for each delivery, but she'd come along with an experienced conductor and 2 other apprentices to accumulate experience. It'd been easy and even fun, they'd spent the 3 day journey joking around and singing karaoke through their intercoms, catching up on audioserials they'd prepared for the journey and getting acquainted with the Rigs' rhythm as it moved through the then-significantly greener terrain. Digital communication was possible; the wireless commu-net blanketed the small planetoid with ease, but most of the route included protected areas with communication limitations as they could disrupt certain fauna and flora behaviors, and using any form of communication within it was strictly meant only for emergencies. She'd considered it then a blessing in disguise, exactly what she needed after her experience at the farm.

She'd woken up earlier last week to sign up for the year end delivery to Whitevale; she'd been looking forward to taking the place of the conductor in her memory, handing toys to gleeful children at the village sent from friends and family they only saw on their commu-net pads. Now a full-fledged Rig Conductor, she'd make the trip alone, but she'd barely had to take the controls on her last journey there save for when their instructor took some time to explain some quirk or another about the machine's functioning, so she saw it as yet another excuse to insulate herself from the world, take a breath.

Now she was asking herself if she belonged here, in her (admittedly) cozy cockpit in the middle of nowhere. The weather report hadn't predicted any adverse conditions this week, though the region was known for its sudden snowfalls. Would her superiors have let her come had they known of the incoming storm? They didn't raise any objections when she signed up for the job, but had they made a mistake? Were they overconfident? Or did they sneer behind her back at a new conductor too full of herself, thought of this as some rite of passage? She brushed the thought aside; her mind often wandered towards such dark places even if she had no evidence and everyone she'd met seemed well intentioned. She reminded herself to breath; surely she'd look back on this experience and laugh (she could feel the legs's rhythm wane again), it'd be nothing but one of many Rig trips she'd go on to complete during this cycle (Hadn't she *just* shaken it off? She hadn't even taken the mug back into her hands), she imagined herself first handing the toys to children, and then being praised by the other conductors back at HQ (the storm was so bad now she could barely see ahead, a blur of white manifesting in the Rig's screen).

Her head began to feel heavy, and her vision began to blur like the landscape on her screen. The smell of cocoa suddenly felt nauseating, and her breathing got uneven. She scrambled to steady herself within the cockpit,
